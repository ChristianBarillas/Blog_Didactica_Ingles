        <p class="english-class">
          This method is based on the belief that learning a foreign language
          involves mastering its grammar rules and vocabulary, and that the best
          way to do this is by translating sentences and texts from the target
          language into the native language, and vice versa. In
          grammar-translation classes, students learn grammatical rules and then
          apply those rules by translating sentences between the target language
          and the native language. The method has two main goals: to enable
          students to read and translate literature written in the target
          language, and to further students’ general intellectual
          development.<br /><br />

          At the beginning of the class we learned about the gramar tranlation
          method that was used in ancient times derived from the classical
          method of teaching Greek and Latin). <br /><br />

          In this method, students are taught to analyze the grammatical
          structures of the target language and to memorize vocabulary through
          translation exercises. The teacher explains the rules of grammar and
          provides vocabulary lists, and the students are required to translate
          texts and sentences from the target language into their native
          language. This approach focuses on accuracy and often emphasizes
          reading and writing skills over speaking and listening.<br /><br />

        </div>

        <p class="english-class">
          In the Direct Method, teachers focus on teaching vocabulary and
          grammar through the use of pictures, objects, and gestures, rather
          than relying on translation. Students are encouraged to speak and
          listen to the target language from the beginning of their language
          learning journey, and are taught to associate meaning with the target
          language rather than with their native language.
          <br /><br />
          And also it emphasizes oral communication and emphasizes the
          importance of learning a language in a natural way, similar to how
          native speakers learn their first language.

          <br><br>

          Unlike the GTM, the natural method discards any use of the mother tongue in the classroom and emphasizes the learning of the second language to be more like the first one that was learned, the grammar is taught inductively, meaning it is taught in context and when a student makes a mistake it is not the end of the world, this method does not focus on the error correction.

        <p class="english-class">
          The Audio-Lingual method of teaching had its origins during World War
          I when it became known as the Army Method. The armies needed to become
          orally proficient in the languages of their allies and enemies as
          quickly as possible. This was first method to be based on linguistic
          theory and behavioral psychology. This suggests that students be
          taught phonology, morphology, and syntax of the language<br />
          <br />

          We also learned in class that there are exercises that are used to
          teach structural patterns.

          <br />
          <br />
          This method emphasizes the teaching of listening and speaking before
          reading and writing. It uses dialogues as the main form of language
          presentation and drills as the main training techniques.

          <br /><br />
          Its basic principles are: <br />
          • Separation of language skills into
          listening, speaking, reading and writing.<br />
          • Use of dialogues as the chief means of presenting the language.<br />
          • Emphasis on certain practice techniques: mimicry, memorization and
          pattern drills.<br />
          • Discouraging the use of the mother tongue in the classroom.<br />

          <br />
          Based on Skinner's Behaviorism theory, it assumed that a human being
          can be trained using a system of reinforcement. Correct behavior
          receives positive feedback, while errors receive negative feedback.<br />

          <br /><br />
          <u> Examples:</u>
          <br /><br />

          1.Repetition drill is oftern used to teach the lines of the dialogue.
          2.Susbtitution drill: the students reapet the line from the dialogue
          the teacher has given them, susbstituing the cue into the line on its
          proper place. 3.Question and answer drill this is a drill that fives
          students practice with answering questions. 4.Transformation frills:
          students change sentence.

          <br /><br />

          In all the previous examples, our teacher showed us in class with
          group activities on the subject about it to understand it in a better
          way.

          The Silent Way was founded in the early 1970s by the Egyptian
          mathematician and educator Caleb Gattegno. It is based on the idea
          that language learning can be enhanced in three main ways: discovery
          rather than teaching; problem-solving in the target language; the use
          of physical tools.

          <br /><br />
          This is one of my favorites because it is simple and it does not
          require the teacher to be a participant in the activity.This method
          has the main principle of giving support to the student when needed,
          errors are important for learning, student attention to the teacher is
          important, transferring students´ ideas, and progress is more
          important than perfection, etc. We mnade activities where we built
          sentences according to the color of the rod and the part of the
          speech. In the second class, we developed a similar activity with
          rods, although we created a story with the rods.

          <br /><br />

          This was a fun activity performed at class where we had to create
          sentences using the color technique with the rods. For example: Color
          red: verb <br />

          Color green: Subject Color pink: Verb Color blue: Complement Color
          yellow: irregular verb Color white: Third person

          We use this method in classes and it was a good tool for learning
          vocabulary.

          <br /><br />

          In this case we refer to a method of teaching language through
          physical activity. And also we made different activities using our
          body to learn vocubulary.

          <br /><br />

          At the class we saw that this method is based on the teaching of its
          creator, James Asher, and in this case one of those concept can be
          that the more often a memory connection is traced, the stronger the
          memory association and the more likely it will be remembered.

          <br /><br />

          We can think that students can learn one part of the language rapidly
          by moving their bodies. And also it is a fun method specially for
          children, making them to have a good time. In addition it does not
          require a great deal of preparation on the part of the teacher.

          <br /><br />

          This method has disavantages since everything can't be explained. And
          Certain target languages may not be suited to this method At the end
          it can be a challenge for shy students. Finally if this method is
          widely used, it can cause displeasure in students.

          This is a method of teaching a foreing language in which students
          learn quickly by feeling relaxed, interested, and positive. And the
          origin was 1970s (Yoga, Psychology) We also learned in classes a
          method of teaching a foreing language in which students learn quickly
          by feeling relaxed, interested, and positive. <br />
          <br />An interesting fact that we learned was that the Origin of the
          Suggestopedia was in the 1970s.<br /><br />

          <u> Examples</u> <br />

          1.The influence of the teacher. <br />
          2.The creativity. <br />
          3. And also it can be, music, write a journey, play some games in
          order to learn in this method. <br />
          <br /><br>

          Teacher Orlando mentioned was that students might fall asleep due to the relaxing music and asked us to write some sentences about our last vacation and also to draw something, all of this while being relaxed listening to the music.

          This method was proposed by Charles Curran, it focuses on speaking and states that peers are needed to learn with and from them, and also it uses authentic material, meaning that it is not designed for teaching purposes

          <br><br>

          This method doesn´t require lesson planning which allows the session to flow and gives the students and teacher the chance to integrate interesting topics, however, there's the risk of not handling time well.


          On the last class we discussed about the community language learning and it was fun. Learning in a community is awesome. Working as a team with my classmates is always great. We disscuss some topics that each group chose. Our topic was childhood memories where we talked about many things that we went through as kids. We recorded the stories and we watch the video and also create some questions. We had the opportunity to work with Authentic Material, which is material that is not designed for teaching purposes

          <br><br>

          Characteristic <br><br>

         1. I need my peers to learn with and from them<br>
2. Non Threatening enviorement to exprees myself better<br>
3. Its better to use it with advanced of proficient learnes<br>
4. Focuses on speaking<br>
5. Nothing is prepared everything flows naturally<br>

    <p class="english-class">

     Hi guys! In this second period the first topic that we discussed in class was <strong>The Collaborative Approach. </strong> And also we talked about collaborative activities (like dialogues, discussions, matching, sorting, role plays, etc.) :D



      <br><br>

     We should consider that collaborative is when a group work is promoted inside the classroom! I enjoyed this new topic in the class rom I'll share you a picture that I did about all this topic above!

     <br><br>

Guys! let's continue with this beutiful topic! I have a question for you :D Do you like working as part of a team? Well, that's what the collaborative approach is all about! It means working together with others to achieve a common goal.

Collaboration involves sharing ideas, listening to others, and working together to come up with solutions. It's important to respect each other's opinions and be open to different ideas.

When we collaborate, we can accomplish great things! We can create amazing projects, solve complex problems, and make the world a better place. Plus, it's a lot more fun to work with others than to go it alone!

So, the next time you have a group project or activity, remember the power of collaboration. Work together, communicate effectively, and be supportive of one another. You might just be surprised at what you can achieve!

    </div>

    <p class="english-class">

     Hello guy! in the class we're learning about this wonderful topic and let me ask you something have you ever heard of multiple intelligences? It's an exciting idea that says there isn't just one type of intelligence, but many. Each one of us has different and special skills that make us smart in different ways.

      For example, some people are really good with words and languages. They might love reading books, telling stories, or learning new languages. This is called linguistic intelligence.
      
      Others are great at solving problems and figuring out puzzles. They might love math or science, and enjoy experimenting and discovering new things. This is called logical-mathematical intelligence.
      
      Some people have a talent for art and design. They might love to draw, paint, or create things with their hands. This is called spatial intelligence.
      
      Others are fantastic at sports and physical activities. They might love to dance, play soccer, or climb trees. This is called bodily-kinesthetic intelligence.
      
      Some people are really good at music. They might love to sing, play an instrument, or compose their own songs. This is called musical intelligence.
      
      There are also people who are great at understanding and connecting with other people. They might be good listeners, great friends, or natural leaders. This is called interpersonal intelligence.
      
      Some people are really good at understanding their own feelings and thoughts. They might be good at reflecting on their experiences, setting goals, and making plans. This is called intrapersonal intelligence.
      
      Finally, there are people who are great at understanding and appreciating the natural world. They might love animals, plants, or rocks, and enjoy exploring and observing the world around them. This is called naturalistic intelligence.
   

      <br><br>

      <br>1.Linguistic intelligence: the ability to use language effectively, including reading, writing, speaking, and listening.
      <br>2.Logical-mathematical intelligence: the ability to reason, problem-solve, and think abstractly.
      <br>3.Spatial intelligence: the ability to think in three dimensions, visualize objects, and mentally manipulate them.
      <br> 4.Bodily-kinesthetic intelligence: the ability to control and coordinate physical movement and handle objects skillfully.
      <br> 5.Musical intelligence: the ability to recognize, create, and appreciate music and musical patterns.
      <br> 6.Interpersonal intelligence: the ability to understand and relate to other people, including recognizing their motivations and emotions.
      <br> 7.Intrapersonal intelligence: the ability to understand one's own thoughts, feelings, and motivations.
      <br>8.Naturalistic intelligence: the ability to observe and appreciate nature, including recognizing and categorizing plants, animals, and natural phenomena.

     Hello guy! We are still in the class presentations but as I listened to my classmates' presentation on spatial intelligence, I was struck by the beauty and wonder of this unique way of thinking. It's the ability to see the world in three dimensions, to envision shapes and objects in our mind's eye, and to manipulate them in our thoughts.

      I learned that spatial intelligence is not just for artists, architects, and engineers - it's for anyone who can appreciate the beauty and complexity of the world around us. It allows us to solve problems, navigate our surroundings, and create things of beauty and utility.
      
      Through the lens of spatial intelligence, the world becomes a canvas, a playground, and a laboratory all at once. It opens up new possibilities for exploration, creativity, and self-expression. It's a gift that can enrich our lives and help us see the world in new and exciting ways.
      
      I left the presentation feeling inspired and awed by the power of spatial intelligence. I realized that it's not just a skill, but a way of seeing and experiencing the world that can bring joy and fulfillment to our lives.
